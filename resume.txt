I love design, technology and all the beautiful things in the world. I have strong passion to user experience and believe in user-centered design can significantly help a company/ product to hit the market and build up brand image. I came into the field of ux with programming background which solidly provides me critical and logical way of thinking and breaking down design questions. With large amount of time i have spent on improving my visual design skills, i now have the ability to produce high quality visual elements and design with Ai and Ps. I also have rich user research experience from industry, my attention has been mostly put on survey design, google analytics analysis and persona building. I believe with my experience and easy going personality, i will definitely bring in fresh air, perspective and cool ideas for deloitte digital. :)
